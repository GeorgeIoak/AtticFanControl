## Project Scripts & Utilities

This project includes several Python scripts to simplify development and deployment.

#### `manage_ui.py`

This is the primary helper script for managing the web UI assets.

- **`python3 manage_ui.py update`**: Regenerates all C++ header files (e.g., `webui_embedded.h`) from the source files in the `data/` directory. Use this when developing for the **embedded UI** (`USE_FS_WEBUI = 0`).
- **`python3 manage_ui.py watch`**: Watches the `data/` directory and automatically runs the `update` command whenever a file is changed. Ideal for live-editing the embedded UI.
- **`python3 manage_ui.py buildfs`**: Packages the contents of the `data/` directory into a `filesystem.bin` image. This is required for deploying the **filesystem UI** (`USE_FS_WEBUI = 1`). See the Deploying the Filesystem UI section for more details.

#### `test_indoor_sensors.py`

Simulates indoor sensor devices by sending test data to the controller's REST API. This is useful for testing the indoor sensor integration without needing physical hardware.

**Requires:** `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

```bash
python3 test_indoor_sensors.py [controller_ip]
```

### `embed_html.py`

A lower-level utility script used by `manage_ui.py`. It embeds a single file (HTML, JS, CSS, or binary) into a C++ header file. You typically won't need to run this directly.

### Software Setup

- Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support
- Add this URL to **Arduino > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs**:

<http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json>

- Use ESP8266 core v3.1.2 or newer for full OTA compatibility

- In **Tools > Flash Size**, select your board's memory size. For most NodeMCU/Wemos boards, this is **4MB**.
- For the partition scheme, choose **`4MB (FS:2MB, OTA:~1019KB)`**. This is often the default and provides 2MB for the data log filesystem, which is ideal for long-term history.
  - *Note: The `manage_ui.py buildfs` script is pre-configured for this 2MB partition size. If you must use a different partition scheme (e.g., 1MB), you will need to edit the script.*

### Wi-Fi Credentials

Create a `secrets.h` file in the sketch directory with the following content. This file stores your sensitive information and is ignored by version control.

```cpp
#pragma once
// WiFi Network
const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

// OTA Update Credentials
const char* ota_user = "admin"; // Default username for OTA updates
const char* ota_password = "your_secure_password"; // Default password for OTA updates

// --- MQTT Configuration (optional) ---
const char* mqtt_broker = "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP";
const int mqtt_port = 1883;
const char* mqtt_user = "YOUR_MQTT_USER";
const char* mqtt_password = "YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD";
```

Add `secrets.h` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it is not committed:

```text
secrets.h
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Web UI Options

The project supports two modes for serving the web interface:

1. **Embedded UI (Default):** The UI is compiled directly into the firmware from header files (e.g., `webui_embedded.h`). This is the default behavior when `USE_FS_WEBUI` is set to `0` in `AtticFanControl.ino`.
2. **Filesystem UI:** The UI is served from files (`index.html`, `atticfan.css`, etc.) on the device's LittleFS filesystem. This mode is required for features like the history chart and is easier for web development.

To switch to the Filesystem UI, set `#define USE_FS_WEBUI 1` in `AtticFanControl.ino` and follow the instructions in the **Deploying the Filesystem UI** section to build and upload the `data/` directory.

> **Note:** The old Arduino IDE 1.x "ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload" plugin is deprecated and not supported in modern IDEs (2.x and newer). Please use the script-based methods described in this document.

---

## üöÄ Deploying the Filesystem UI

This project can serve a rich web interface from its onboard flash memory (LittleFS). This is required for features like the history chart.

**The Golden Rule:** When switching to the filesystem UI, you must upload the filesystem image to the device *before* you upload the firmware that is configured to use it.

> **Note on OTA Credentials:**
>
> - **Arduino IDE (Network Port):** Prompts for a **password only**. Use the `ota_password` from your `secrets.h` file.
> - **Web UI (ElegantOTA):** Prompts for a **username and password**. Use `ota_user` and `ota_password` from `secrets.h`.

### Step 1: Build the Filesystem Image

This project includes a helper script to build the filesystem image safely. It automatically cleans temporary log files from the `data/` directory before packaging.

From a terminal in the project's root directory, run:

```bash
python3 manage_ui.py buildfs
```

This packs the contents of the `data/` folder into a `filesystem.bin` file.

### Step 2: Change the Firmware Flag

In `AtticFanControl.ino`, change the flag to `1` to tell the firmware to use the files from the filesystem:

```cpp
#define USE_FS_WEBUI 1
```

### Step 3: Upload Files to the Device

Choose one of the following methods to upload the filesystem and the new firmware.

#### Method A: OTA Upload (Recommended for Developers)

This is the fastest method if you are actively developing.

1. **Upload Filesystem via Web:** Navigate to the device's web UI and go to the `/update` page. Click the **"Filesystem"** button, choose the `filesystem.bin` file, and upload it. The device will reboot.
2. **Upload Firmware via IDE:**
    - In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Port**. You should see your device listed as a network port (e.g., `AtticFan at 192.168.1.123`).
    - Select this network port.
    - Click the regular "Upload" button in the IDE. Arduino will compile and upload the new firmware over the air.

> **Troubleshooting IDE OTA:** If the Arduino IDE fails with an "Authentication Failed" error and doesn't prompt for a password, it has likely cached incorrect credentials.
>
> 1. **First, try restarting the IDE.** Completely quit and reopen the Arduino IDE. This is the most common fix, as it clears the IDE's temporary cache and will prompt for the password again on the next upload attempt.
> 2. **If restarting fails, change the hostname as a last resort.** This is a more forceful way to clear the cache. Change the `MDNS_HOSTNAME` in `hardware.h` (e.g., from `"AtticFan"` to `"AtticFanController"`), upload this change via USB one last time, and restart the IDE. This forces the IDE to discover the device as "new" and re-authenticate.

#### Method B: OTA Upload (Web UI Only)

This method is useful for updating a device without needing the Arduino IDE.

1. **Export the Firmware:** In the Arduino IDE (with `USE_FS_WEBUI = 1`), compile and export the firmware binary using **Sketch > Export Compiled Binary**. This will create a `.bin` file in your sketch folder.
2. **Upload Filesystem:** Navigate to the device's web UI and go to the `/update` page. Click the **"Filesystem"** button, choose the `filesystem.bin` file, and upload it. The device will reboot.
3. **Upload Firmware:** After it reconnects, return to the `/update` page. Click the **"Firmware"** button, choose the new firmware `.bin` file you exported, and upload it.

#### Method C: Wired Upload (Initial Flash or Recovery)

Use this method for the very first time you program a blank device.

1. Connect the device to your computer via USB.
2. **Upload Filesystem:** Upload the filesystem image using `esptool.py`. Replace `COM3` with your device's serial port. The flash address `0x200000` is the correct starting address for the filesystem on a 4MB board.

    ```bash
    esptool.py --port COM3 write_flash 0x200000 filesystem.bin
    ```

3. **Upload Firmware:** Use the Arduino IDE to upload the sketch normally via the USB serial port.

## üè† Indoor Sensor Integration

The Attic Fan Controller supports multiple ESP8266-based indoor sensors that report temperature and humidity to the main controller via HTTP POST requests. Indoor sensors are auto-discovered and displayed in the web UI, and can be integrated with Home Assistant via MQTT auto-discovery.

### Indoor Sensor Features

- **Multiple Sensor Support**: Register up to 10 indoor sensors, each with a unique ID and name.
- **Automatic Registration & Discovery**: Sensors register themselves automatically when they send data; no manual setup required on the controller.
- **Web UI Integration**: Indoor sensor data (average and per-room) is displayed in the main controller's dashboard, with a modal for details.
- **Timeout Management**: Inactive sensors are automatically removed after 30 minutes.
- **Data Validation**: Sensor values are checked for reasonable ranges before being accepted.
- **REST API**: Full API for submitting, listing, and removing sensors and their data (see API Reference section).
- **MQTT & Home Assistant Integration**: Indoor sensor data is published to MQTT (if enabled), with Home Assistant auto-discovery for all sensors.

### Indoor Sensor Setup

1. **Hardware**: Use an ESP8266 board (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.) with a supported temperature/humidity sensor (SHT21, SHT20, or BME280) connected via I2C.

2. **Software**: Open the `IndoorSensorClient/IndoorSensorClient.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE (separate from the main controller).

   - Copy `secrets_example.h` to `secrets.h` and enter your WiFi credentials.
   - Set a unique `SENSOR_ID` and `SENSOR_NAME` in the sketch for each device.
   - By default, the sensor will auto-discover the main controller using mDNS (`AtticFan.local`). If mDNS fails, set `FALLBACK_CONTROLLER_IP` in the sketch.
   - Upload the sketch to your ESP8266 indoor sensor.

3. **Configuration**:

- Sensors register automatically when they send data‚Äîno manual steps needed on the controller.
- Enable or disable indoor sensor support in the main controller's config (web UI > config panel).

### Example Indoor Sensor Configuration

```cpp
// In IndoorSensorClient.ino
const String SENSOR_ID = "bedroom_01";        // Unique identifier
const String SENSOR_NAME = "Master Bedroom";  // Display name
const unsigned long POST_INTERVAL = 30000;    // Send every 30 seconds
```

### Integration with Fan Logic

Currently, indoor sensor data is collected, displayed, and published to MQTT/Home Assistant. Future firmware updates may use indoor sensor data for advanced automation, such as:

- Whole-house fan control based on indoor/outdoor temperature differential
- Humidity-based ventilation control
- Zone-specific climate monitoring
- Smart scheduling based on occupancy patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Disclaimers

- **High Voltage Warning:** This project involves controlling mains voltage (120V/240V AC). Working with high voltage is extremely dangerous and can result in injury or death. Always disconnect power before working on the circuit.
- **Test Safely:** Always test your setup with a low-voltage load (like an LED or a small DC fan) before connecting a high-power attic fan.
- **Use Proper Protection:** Use a properly rated fuse and ensure your wiring and relay can handle the fan's current draw.
- **Network Security:** If you expose this device to the internet, ensure you use strong, unique passwords for both OTA updates and MQTT to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## üß† Potential Future Plans

- **Advanced Sensor Discovery:** A more robust auto-configuration protocol for discovering and managing both the main controller and sensor nodes.
- **Mobile App:** A simple companion app for monitoring and control.
- **UI Enhancements:** Add light/dark mode to the web interface.
